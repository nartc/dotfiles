# Synthetic Check Investigator

Investigate Synthetic Monitoring check failures by triaging probe data, classifying failure scope, and identifying root cause. Experienced operators need actionable diagnosis, not hand-holding.

## Core Principles

1. Use gcx commands — do not call Grafana APIs directly
2. Trust the user's expertise — skip background explanations
3. Use `-o json` for agent processing, default format for user display
4. Show timeline graphs for time-series data — they communicate trends faster than text
5. Collect errors; report them at the end, not interleaved in workflow steps

## Prerequisites

gcx configured with an active context and appropriate permissions.

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Get Check Status (with early exit)

```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring checks status <ID>
```

If the user provided a name instead of ID, list first:
```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring checks list -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.job | test("<name>"; "i")) | [.id, .job, .target, .type] | @tsv'
```

**Early exit — OK:** Check success rate >= 50% across all probes.
Report: "Check `<job>` is healthy. Success rate: <rate>%. <probe_count> probes up."
Stop unless the user asks for more.

**Early exit — NODATA:** No Prometheus metrics available.
1. Get check config to verify `enabled: true` (`gcx synthetic-monitoring checks get <ID> -o json | jq .spec.enabled`)
2. If disabled: report "Check is disabled — no metrics will appear until it is re-enabled."
3. If enabled: report "No metrics found. Check datasource config or whether the SM stack is healthy."
Stop after reporting.

### Step 2: Get Check Configuration

```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring checks get <ID> -o json
```

Extract: job name, target, check type (http/ping/dns/tcp/traceroute), probe list, frequency, timeout, alertSensitivity, enabled flag.

For HTTP checks also note: any assertion settings, TLS config, expected status codes.

### Step 3: Timeline Triage

```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring checks timeline <ID> --from now-1h --to now
```

Show the graph output to the user. Then analyze the pattern:

| Pattern | Classification |
|---------|---------------|
| All probes at 0 (or near 0) | Target down |
| Subset of probes at 0, others healthy | Regional / network |
| Intermittent drops across multiple probes | Flapping / timeout |
| All probes drop at a specific point in time | Sudden onset — possible deployment or config change |
| Gradual decline | Degradation — timeout drift or resource exhaustion |

Use a longer window if the failure started more than 1h ago:
```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring checks timeline <ID> --from now-6h --to now
```

### Step 4: Classify Failure Scope and Map Probes

Get the probe list for geographic mapping:
```bash
gcx synthetic-monitoring probes list -o json
```

Cross-reference probe IDs from the check config against probe regions. Map failing probes to their regions.

**All probes failing:** Target/service issue — likely target down, SSL error, or DNS failure.

**Subset of probes failing:** Regional or network issue. Note which regions are affected:
- Single region → ISP/CDN routing issue or regional outage
- Multiple contiguous regions → CDN edge or routing policy issue
- Probe-specific → private probe infra issue (if using private probes)

**Intermittent failures:** Flapping. Consider: rate limiting, timeout too tight, flaky connectivity.

### Step 5: Per-Probe Breakdown via PromQL (when datasource is available)

Resolve datasource UID if not already known:
```bash
gcx datasources list --type prometheus
```

Run per-probe success rate to pinpoint failing probes:
```bash
gcx metrics query <datasource-uid> \
  'avg by (probe) (probe_success{job="<job>",instance="<target>"})' \
  --from now-1h --to now --step 1m -o json
```

Show as graph for the user:
```bash
gcx metrics query <datasource-uid> \
  'avg by (probe) (probe_success{job="<job>",instance="<target>"})' \
  --from now-1h --to now --step 1m -o graph
```

For HTTP checks, also run HTTP phase latency to locate where time is spent:
```bash
gcx metrics query <datasource-uid> \
  'avg by (phase) (probe_http_duration_seconds{job="<job>",instance="<target>"})' \
  --from now-1h --to now --step 1m -o graph
```

For SSL/TLS failures or near-expiry concerns:
```bash
gcx metrics query <datasource-uid> \
  '(probe_ssl_earliest_cert_expiry{job="<job>",instance="<target>"} - time()) / 86400' \
  --from now-1h --to now --step 5m -o json
```

See `references/sm-promql-patterns.md` for full PromQL pattern library.

### Step 6: Classify Failure Mode

Cross-reference signals against `references/failure-modes.md` to select the most likely failure mode:

1. All probes failing + HTTP non-2xx or connection refused → **Target down**
2. Subset of probes failing → **Regional/CDN**
3. TLS handshake error or cert expiry < 14 days → **SSL/TLS**
4. DNS resolution errors across probes → **DNS resolution**
5. All probes timing out, phase latency high in `connect` or `tls` → **Timeout**
6. Probes reaching target but assertion fails (status code, body match) → **Content/assertion**
7. Single private probe failing, public probes healthy → **Private probe infra**
8. HTTP 429 responses, intermittent failures with backoff pattern → **Rate limiting**

### Step 7: Diagnosis and Next Actions

Synthesize findings into an actionable report (see Output Format below).

Next actions depend on failure mode:
- **Target down**: Check service health, recent deployments, upstream dependencies
- **Regional/CDN**: Check CDN config, BGP routes, regional incidents for affected regions
- **SSL/TLS**: Renew cert if expiring; check intermediate chain; verify TLS config
- **DNS resolution**: Check DNS provider status, record TTLs, CNAME chains
- **Timeout**: Increase check timeout (must stay < frequency); investigate latency spikes
- **Content/assertion**: Check if response body/status code changed due to a deployment
- **Private probe infra**: Check private probe agent health and connectivity
- **Rate limiting**: Reduce check frequency or add allowlist for SM probe IPs

If deeper investigation is needed (e.g., logs, infra repos), ask the user if they want to proceed.

If check config needs changes (probe selection, frequency, assertions), route to **synth-manage-checks**.

## Output Format

**Early exit (OK):**
```
Check: <job> (<target>)
Status: OK
Success rate: <rate>%
Probes up: <count>/<total>
```

**Early exit (NODATA):**
```
Check: <job> (<target>)
Status: NODATA
Enabled: <yes/no>
Next: <datasource check / re-enable instruction>
```

**Full investigation:**
```
Check: <job> (<target>)
Type: <http|ping|dns|tcp|traceroute>
Status: FAILING
Success rate: <rate>% (window: <from> – <to>)

[Timeline graph]

Failure classification: <Target down | Regional/CDN | SSL/TLS | DNS | Timeout | Content/assertion | Private probe infra | Rate limiting>

Affected probes: <count>/<total>
  - <probe-name> (<region>): failing since <time>
  - <probe-name> (<region>): intermittent

Onset: <time/duration or "unknown">

Diagnosis:
<2-4 sentences describing what the data shows and the most likely cause>

Next actions:
1. <action>
2. <action>
3. <action>
```

Use minimal formatting. Avoid excessive bold text. Trust the user to prioritize.

## Error Handling

- `gcx synthetic-monitoring checks status` returns no rows: check ID may be wrong — list all checks and confirm
- `gcx synthetic-monitoring probes list` fails: skip geographic mapping; classify probes by name where possible
- `gcx datasources {kind} query` fails with datasource error: note it, skip PromQL steps, classify using timeline data only
- Multiple checks match the search name: list all with IDs and targets, ask which to investigate
- Timeline returns no data for the window: widen to `--from now-6h --to now` before concluding NODATA
